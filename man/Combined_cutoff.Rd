\arguments{
\item{data}{dataframe to be analyzed.}

\item{SD.cutoff}{numeric cutoff value for Standard Deviation, 'default' value set to 5.}

\item{SD.condition}{character string of condition that is desired for comparison of data to SD cutoff value, i.e <, >=, etc. 'Default' logic set to "<=".}

\item{TPI.cutoff}{numeric cutoff value for Time per Item, 'default' value set to 1.}

\item{TPI.condition}{character string of condition that is desired for comparison of data to TPI cutoff value, i.e <, >=, etc. 'Default' logic set to "<=".}

\item{Perc.Mode.cutoff}{numeric cutoff value for the Percent of Item scores at Mode, 'default' value set to 0.7.}

\item{Perc.Mode.condition}{character string of condition that is desired for comparison of data to Percent of Items at Mode cutoff value, i.e <, >=, etc. 'Default' logic set to ">=".}

\item{Combined.logic}{character string of logic that is desired for classifying the use of the  SD, TPI, and  Percent of Items at Mode cutoff values, 'default' logic set to 'OR'.}

\item{ttc.colnames}{vector of column names of "Start Time" and "End Time" to calculate time to complete, also can be "Completion Time" if already calculated.}

\item{number.items}{integer, number of items per assessment.}

\item{mandatory.response}{logical value based on whether response to items in each assessment were mandatory to complete.}

\item{item.colnames}{vector of column names of all items/questions to be used to calculate item score Standard Deviation responses.}

\item{ID.colname}{character string of column name for ID of assessment.}
}
\value{
The item \code{"ttc.colnames"} must be the names of columns, corresponding to Start Time and End Time, ordered \code{ttc.colnames = c("StartTime", "EndTime")} start time first, followed by end time. If the data includes assessment duration, then list the column name that corresponds with assessment completion: \code{ttc.colnames = "SurveyDuration"}

The item \code{"mandatory.response"} should be \strong{\code{TRUE}} if participants were required to complete all items per assessment. This item should be \strong{\code{FALSE}} if not all items were required to be completed per assessment.

If there is variability in the items that are asked, mark the item \code{"mandatory.response"} as \strong{\code{FALSE}} and ensure that \code{"item.colnames"} includes all items.

\description{
\code{Combined_cutoff} returns dataframe of assessment flagged by any of these three cutoff values: Standard Deviation per assessment, Time per Item.
}
\details{
This function creates the dataframe that includes the ID and index of assessments that met the cutoff criteria for \emph{Standard Deviation per assessment}, \emph{Time per Item}, and \emph{Percent of Items at Mode }.
If an assessment has a Standard Deviation \strong{less than or equal to} the cutoff value, a Time per Item \strong{less than or equal to} the cutoff value, or the Percent of Items scores at the Mode is \strong{greater than or equal to} the cutoff value, it will be flagged and placed in the dataframe.
This function uses the Boolean logic \emph{"OR"} in order to identify assessments that meet any of the listed criteria.
This function allows users to customize cutoff conditions for each separate cutoff to \strong{"<", ">", "<=", ">="}. The default values for the cutoff conditions will be set as described before.
This function allows users to customize the Boolean logic to \strong{"AND", "OR"}. The default values for the Boolean logic will be set as \emph{"OR"} between all three criteria.
